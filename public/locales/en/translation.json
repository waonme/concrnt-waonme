Some password managers struggle with handling Japanese characters as passwords.\n2. Logging in with the Master Key creates a new session.\n\nYou can copy your Sub Key from Settings > ID Management while logged in under normal mode. Sub Key login works via the same login screen as the Master Key, with a dedicated input field.\n\n## Other Features\n\n### Sub-Profiles\nConcrnt lets you create multiple profiles. You can choose which profile to use when posting.\n\n### ActivityPub Integration\nBy enabling ActivityPub integration, you can interact with other ActivityPub-compatible platforms (Mastodon, Misskey, Pleroma, etc.).\n\n### Data Management & Migration\nConcrnt is a decentralized SNS, allowing you to manage your own data.\nTo safeguard against server shutdowns, regularly export your data from Settings > Data Management and keep it securely.\nYou can also migrate to a different server if your current one shuts down."
